JMeter - WebSocket Sampler with Ping Support.

This is a modified version of maciejzaleski/JMeter-WebSocketSampler that takes in the changes to thread pooling and cookie handling from tradingscreen/JMeter-WebSocketSampler

Ping support is added to allow long-lived connections to stay open regardless of TCP timeout.
